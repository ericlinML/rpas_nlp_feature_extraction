# Code for extracting thought incoherence NLP features for the "Using Natural Language Processing to Assess Disorganized Speech on the Rorschach" symposium presentation at the 2023 Convention for the Society of Personality Assessment

Manuscript currently under preparation 

Jupyter notebook contains code that extracts previously published NLP features that have been shown to index thought or semantic incoherence, a common feature seen in psychotic disorders. We compare semantic incoherence features obtained by cosine similarity comparisons between vectors derived from word2vec, GloVe, BERT (as well as RoBERTa).
